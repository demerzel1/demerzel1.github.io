I am currently a **Staff Machine Learning Engineer** at **HONOR Robotics Lab**, focusing on **Embodied AI**, **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models, and World Models. 

Previously, I worked as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at **DiDi Global (Voyager Group)**, specializing in autonomous driving perception and generative data synthesis. I received my Master's degree from **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)** in 2022.

My research interests lie in **Robotics Perception**, **Large Multimodal Models**, and **Data Synthesis** for autonomous systems.
